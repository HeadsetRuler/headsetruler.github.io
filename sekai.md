Multi-Lobby Titles:
---
Ace = MVP of losing team in Cheerful Carnival  
MVP = highest scoring player  
Superstar = MVP with a large lead over the №2 scorer  

Multi-live skills: 
---
* **!!!ORDER IS STATIC!!!**:
		 2→1→4→5→3→MVP('on fire')  
* non-score effects: only from leader  
* score effect: +100% + leader + other members÷5  
* this respects requirements PER CARD, even if they're not the leader (so if card №3 is a PScorer, their fraction on a GREAT will be 0 instead of x/5)  
* yes, the +100% means you will always get AT LEAST +100% score during skill windows
